## Goal
I'm a ruby programmer trying to learn other languages. Recently, I have done some Code Kata
practice and think this will be a fun way to learn other langauges.
Here is the learning process I will try.

1. (Prepare) Solve a Code Kata, from web or create one, in Ruby.
2. (Learn) Solve the same problem in other languages.
3. (Master) Resolve the same problem again and again until feel happy.
